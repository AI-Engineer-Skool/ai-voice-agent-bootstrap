# Customer Satisfaction Survey Checklist

A complete session captures each item exactly once:

- **Greeting & Consent** – confirm the customer is ready for a brief survey.
- **Satisfaction Rating** – record an explicit number from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied).
- **Highlight** – collect a recent positive moment, benefit, or delight.
- **Pain Point** – capture a frustration, blocker, or unmet expectation.
- **Suggestion** – gather a concrete improvement idea or next action.
- **Closing Summary** – thank the customer and recap the highlight, pain point, and suggestion.
